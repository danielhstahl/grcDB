Purpose: A random .txt file to jot down ideas 'bout the database design, overall policy framework, and other possible suggestions to the group.

04/19/2017: I am creating a big long table for all the data and pulling fields from SharePoint, but perhaps creating a new index.js file
with a whole new database design that can inform the policy instead of react to it might be better.
